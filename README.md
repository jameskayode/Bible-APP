# Bible-AP
* I want to be design an homepage such that when on launching the application,  a random scripture displayed on the page.
* to achieve the step above, i will create an HTML homepage file, which will a div container that houses the bible text displaying randomly with a set interval which will be styled and the js function will be added ("home.js")
* And alongside the verse container i will have a READ button when it's clicked takes us to the main page
* At the main page, i will have a styled UL tags which will house the new old testament and another with new testament which will also each have LI tags container the books (Genesis, Exodus) which will be arranged alphabetically
* the LI buttons will have an action button which when clicked on displays the chapters which will be 10 each..
* when a chapter is clicked on it takes us a new page containing 20 verses which will be fetched from a local JSON file.
